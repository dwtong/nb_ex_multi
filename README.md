# Norns mod. Disting ex nb voice.

This implementation is pretty simple. I have tested it with the following Disting Ex modes:
* SD Multisample
* Poly Wavetable
* Poly Exciter
* Macro Oscillator

Each of these you will have to configure within the ex's tiny screen yourself, but then you can play notes using nb. It always uses the Disting's internal voice allocator.

I think it would be cool if it worked with these but I haven't found a working setup:
* Filter Bank
* Resonator
